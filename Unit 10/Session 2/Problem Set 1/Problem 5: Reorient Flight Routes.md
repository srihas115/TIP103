# Problem 5: Reorient Flight Routes

There are `n` airports numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` direct flight routes between airports such that there is exactly one way to travel between any two airports (this network forms a tree). Last year, the aviation authority decided to orient the flight routes in one direction due to air traffic regulations.

Flight routes are represented by `connections`, where `connections[i] = [airport_a, airport_b]` represents a one-way flight route from airport `airport_a` to airport `airport_b`.

This year, there will be a major aviation event at the central hub (airport `0`), and many flights need to reach this hub. 

Your task is to reorient some flight routes so that every airport can send flights to airport `0`. Return the minimum number of flight routes that need to be reoriented.

It is guaranteed that after the reordering, each airport will be able to send a flight to airport `0`.

```python
def min_reorient_flight_routes(n, connections):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
n = 6
connections = [[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 0], [4, 5]]

print(min_reorient_flight_routes(n, connections))
```

Example Output:

```markdown
3
Explanation: 
- Initially, the flight routes are: 0 -> 1, 1 -> 3, 2 -> 3, 4 -> 0, 4 -> 5
- We need to reorient the routes [1, 3], [2, 3], and [4, 5] to ensure that every airport can send a flight to airport 0.
```
