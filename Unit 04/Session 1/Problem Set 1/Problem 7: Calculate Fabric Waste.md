# Problem 7: Calculate Fabric Waste

In the sustainable fashion industry, minimizing waste is crucial. After cutting out patterns for clothing items, there are often leftover pieces of fabric that cannot be used. Your task is to calculate the total amount of fabric waste generated after producing a collection of clothing items. Each clothing item requires a certain amount of fabric, and the available fabric rolls come in fixed lengths.

Write the `calculate_fabric_waste()` function, which takes a list of clothing items (each with a required fabric length) and a list of fabric rolls (each with a specific length). The function should return the total fabric waste after producing all the items.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```
def calculate_fabric_waste(items, fabric_rolls):
    pass
```

Example Usage:

```
items = [("T-Shirt", 2), ("Pants", 3), ("Jacket", 5)]
fabric_rolls = [5, 5, 5]

items_2 = [("Dress", 4), ("Skirt", 3), ("Blouse", 2)]
fabric_rolls = [4, 4, 4]

items_3 = [("Jacket", 6), ("Shirt", 2), ("Shorts", 3)]
fabric_rolls = [7, 5, 5]

print(calculate_fabric_waste(items, fabric_rolls))
print(calculate_fabric_waste(items_2, fabric_rolls))
print(calculate_fabric_waste(items_3, fabric_rolls))
```

Example Output:

```
5
3
6
