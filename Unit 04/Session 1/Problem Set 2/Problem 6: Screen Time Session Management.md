# Problem 6: Screen Time Session Management

As part of a digital wellbeing initiative, you're designing a system to manage screen time sessions on a device. The device tracks various apps being opened and closed throughout the day. Each app opening starts a new session, and each closing ends that session. The system should ensure that for every app opened, there is a corresponding closure.

Write the `manage_screen_time_sessions()` function, which takes a list of actions representing app openings and closures throughout the day. Each action is either `"OPEN <app>"` or `"CLOSE <app>"`. The function should return `True` if all the app sessions are properly managed (i.e., every opened app has a corresponding close in the correct order), and `False` otherwise.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```
def manage_screen_time_sessions(actions):
  pass
```

Example Usage:

```
actions = ["OPEN Instagram", "OPEN Facebook", "CLOSE Facebook", "CLOSE Instagram"]
actions_2 = ["OPEN Instagram", "CLOSE Instagram", "CLOSE Facebook"]
actions_3 = ["OPEN Instagram", "OPEN Facebook", "CLOSE Instagram", "CLOSE Facebook"]

print(manage_screen_time_sessions(actions))
print(manage_screen_time_sessions(actions_2))
print(manage_screen_time_sessions(actions_3))
```

Example Output:

```
True
False
False
```
