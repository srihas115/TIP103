# Problem 3: Track Scene Transitions

Given a list of scenes in a story, use a queue to keep track of the transitions from one scene to the next. You need to simulate the transitions by processing each scene in the order they appear and print out each transition from the current scene to the next.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```python
def track_scene_transitions(scenes):
  pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
scenes = ["Opening", "Rising Action", "Climax", "Falling Action", "Resolution"]
track_scene_transitions(scenes)

scenes = ["Introduction", "Conflict", "Climax", "Denouement"]
track_scene_transitions(scenes)
```

Example Output:

```markdown
Transition from Opening to Rising Action
Transition from Rising Action to Climax
Transition from Climax to Falling Action
Transition from Falling Action to Resolution

Transition from Introduction to Conflict
Transition from Conflict to Climax
Transition from Climax to Denouement
```
