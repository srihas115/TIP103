# Problem 4: Organize Scene Data by Date

Given a list of scene records, where each record contains a date and a description, sort the list by date and return the sorted list. Each record is a tuple where the first element is the date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format and the second element is the description of the scene.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```python
def organize_scene_data_by_date(scene_records):
  pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
scene_records = [
    ("2024-08-15", "Climax"),
    ("2024-08-10", "Introduction"),
    ("2024-08-20", "Resolution"),
    ("2024-08-12", "Rising Action")
]
print(organize_scene_data_by_date(scene_records))

scene_records = [
    ("2023-07-05", "Opening"),
    ("2023-07-07", "Conflict"),
    ("2023-07-01", "Setup"),
    ("2023-07-10", "Climax")
]
print(organize_scene_data_by_date(scene_records))
```

Example Output:

```markdown
[('2024-08-10', 'Introduction'), ('2024-08-12', 'Rising Action'), ('2024-08-15', 'Climax'), ('2024-08-20', 'Resolution')]
[('2023-07-01', 'Setup'), ('2023-07-05', 'Opening'), ('2023-07-07', 'Conflict'), ('2023-07-10', 'Climax')]
```
