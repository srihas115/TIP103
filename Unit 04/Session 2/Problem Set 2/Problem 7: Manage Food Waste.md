# Problem 7: Manage Food Waste

You are tasked with managing food waste records using a queue to simulate the process of handling waste reduction over time. Each record contains a date (in the format `"YYYY-MM-DD"`) and the amount of food wasted on that date. You will process these records using a queue to manage the waste reduction. Return `True` if the total waste in the queue decreases over time as records are processed and `False` otherwise.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```python
def manage_food_waste_with_queue(waste_records):
  pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
waste_records_1 = [
    ("2024-08-01", 150),
    ("2024-08-02", 120),
    ("2024-08-03", 100),
    ("2024-08-04", 80),
    ("2024-08-05", 60)
]

waste_records_2 = [
    ("2024-08-01", 150),
    ("2024-08-02", 180),
    ("2024-08-03", 160),
    ("2024-08-04", 140),
    ("2024-08-05", 120)
]

print(manage_food_waste_with_queue(waste_records_1)) 
print(manage_food_waste_with_queue(waste_records_2))
```

Example Output:

```markdown
True
False
```
