# Problem 8: Manage Expiration Dates

Simulate managing food items in a pantry by using a stack to keep track of their expiration dates. Determine if the items are ordered correctly by expiration date (the first item to expire should be at the top of the stack). Return `True` if items are ordered correctly and `False` otherwise.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```python
def check_expiration_order(expiration_dates):
  pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
expiration_dates_1 = [
    ("Milk", "2024-08-05"),
    ("Bread", "2024-08-10"),
    ("Eggs", "2024-08-12"),
    ("Cheese", "2024-08-15")
]

expiration_dates_2 = [
    ("Cheese", "2024-08-15"),
    ("Bread", "2024-08-12"),
    ("Eggs", "2024-08-10"),
    ("Milk", "2024-08-05")
]

print(check_expiration_order(expiration_dates_1)) 
print(check_expiration_order(expiration_dates_2)) 
```

Example Output:

```markdown
True
False
```
