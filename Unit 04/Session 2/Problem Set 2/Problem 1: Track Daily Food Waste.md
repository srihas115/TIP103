# Problem 1: Track Daily Food Waste

You are given a dictionary where the keys are dates in the format `"YYYY-MM-DD"` and the values are lists of integers representing the amounts of food waste (in grams) recorded on that date. Your task is to calculate the total amount of food waste for each day and return the dates and the total waste amounts for those dates.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```python
def track_daily_food_waste(waste_records):
  pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
waste_records1 = {
    "2024-08-01": [200, 150, 50],
    "2024-08-02": [300, 400],
    "2024-08-03": [100]
}

result = track_daily_food_waste(waste_records1)
print(result)

waste_records2 = {
    "2024-07-01": [120, 80],
    "2024-07-02": [150, 200, 50],
    "2024-07-03": [300, 100]
}

result = track_daily_food_waste(waste_records2)
print(result)
```

Example Output:

```markdown
{'2024-08-01': 400, '2024-08-02': 700, '2024-08-03': 100}
{'2024-07-01': 200, '2024-07-02': 400, '2024-07-03': 400}
```
