# Problem 3: Sort Waste Records by Date

You are given a list of tuples where each tuple contains a date (as a string in the format `"YYYY-MM-DD"`) and a list of integers representing the amount of food wasted on that date. Your task is to sort this list by date in ascending order and return the sorted list.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

```python
def sort_waste_records_by_date(waste_records):
  pass
```

Example Usage:

```python
waste_records1 = [
    ("2024-08-15", [300, 200]),
    ("2024-08-13", [150, 100]),
    ("2024-08-14", [200, 250]),
    ("2024-08-12", [100, 50])
]

result = sort_waste_records_by_date(waste_records1)
print(result)

waste_records2 = [
    ("2024-07-05", [400, 150]),
    ("2024-07-01", [200, 300]),
    ("2024-07-03", [100, 100]),
    ("2024-07-04", [50, 50])
]

result = sort_waste_records_by_date(waste_records2)
print(result)
```

Example Output:

```markdown
[('2024-08-12', [100, 50]), ('2024-08-13', [150, 100]), ('2024-08-14', [200, 250]), ('2024-08-15', [300, 200])]
[('2024-07-01', [200, 300]), ('2024-07-03', [100, 100]), ('2024-07-04', [50, 50]), ('2024-07-05', [400, 150])]
```
