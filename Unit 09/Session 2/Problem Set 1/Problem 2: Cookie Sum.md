# Problem 2: Cookie Sum

Given the `root` of a binary tree where each node's value represents a certain number of cookies, return the number of unique paths from the `root` to a leaf node where the total number of cookies equals a given `target_sum`.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your function. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity. Evaluate the complexities for both a balanced and unbalanced tree.

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def count_cookie_paths(root, target_sum):
    pass
```

```python
"""
    10
   /  \
  5     8
 / \   / \
3   7 12  4
"""
# Using build_tree() function included at the top of the page
cookie_nums = [10, 5, 8, 3, 7, 12, 4]
cookies1 = build_tree(cookie_nums)

"""
    8
   / \
  4   12
 / \    \
2   6    10
"""
cookie_nums = [8, 4, 12, 2, 6, None, 10]
cookies2 = build_tree(cookie_nums)

print(count_cookie_paths(cookies1, 22)) 
print(count_cookie_paths(cookies2, 14)) 

```

Example Output:
